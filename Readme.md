# AI-Powered Chatbot for Coding and Document Queries

## Overview
This project consists of two main components:
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles text, document (PDF), and audio queries using the Groq API for coding and document-based queries.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Provides an intuitive chat interface for users to interact with the system by entering text, uploading documents, or audio queries.

The chatbot processes user inputs and generates relevant answers using a language model. You can customize the backend to integrate different models for various tasks.

## Features
- **Text Queries**: Users can ask questions directly in text format.
- **Document Queries**: Upload PDFs and ask questions based on the document content.
- **Audio Queries**: Upload audio files, which are transcribed and used for generating responses.
- **Chat History**: Automatically saves per user in the `chats` folder for future reference.
